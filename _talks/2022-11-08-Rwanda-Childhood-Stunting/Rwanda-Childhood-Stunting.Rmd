#### Abstract

__Background:__ 

Over the past years, Rwanda has experienced the sound economic development and
improvement in living standards. Contrary, lasting malnutrition and stunting among children aged less than five years remains stubbornly high and drawbacks their living standards regardless of its economic progress. Malnutrition considers main reason of children morbidity and mortality in the planet scenario, specifically in the developing countries including Rwanda. Additionally, childhood malnutrition severely affects their physical, cognitive growth and academic achievements hence poor human capital and national productivity. This study aimed to find out the crucial effect of socio-economic factors on malnutrition
children aged under five years in Rwanda.

__Methods:__

Using cross-sectional data of 30,056 children obtained from the Rwanda 2019-2020 Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS), this study develops a novel approach of Multinomial Logistic Regression for empirical estimation of the magnitude effects of socio-economic factors linked to the nutrition status among children under five years of age in Rwanda. The Odds Ratio (OR) and Average Marginal Effect (AME) have been used to quantify the effects of socio-economic factors on childhood
nutrition status; where the confusion matrix has been extensively used to assess the performance and reliability of the estimated model.

__Results:__

Empirical results of this study revealed that the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting was approximately $34.2\% [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 29.8−34.6]$ and $10.4\% [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 16.3−24.8]$ respectively
among children particularly in rural areas of Rwanda. The multivariate analysis specified that the most stunting status were significantly associated with household wealth quintile, poor and poorest families $ (OR = 1.0366;0.756 [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 1.234−3.376], 𝐴𝑀𝐸 = 0.327;0.285)$, maternal education(no and primary schooling) $(𝑂𝑅 = 1.043;1.004 [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 1.584−2.976], 𝐴𝑀𝐸 = 0.0083;0.0074)$,
parent’s occupation (unemployed, domestics and famers) $(𝑂𝑅 = 0.842;0.649 [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 0.780−1.760], 𝐴𝑀𝐸 =0.0484;0.067)$, Household size $(𝑂𝑅 = 0.998;0.996 [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 2.34−4.76], 𝐴𝑀𝐸 = 0.0034;0.006)$.
Stunting was highly correlated with the maternal age and her age at first marriage (younger and early
married mothers). The results showed also, that stunting was mostly correlated with male gender
$(𝑂𝑅 = 1.004;0.985 [97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 3.41−4.56], 𝐴𝑀𝐸 = 0.5413;0.374)$, children of urban areas(Kigali
city) $(𝑂𝑅 = 0.991;0.978,97.5\%𝐶𝐼 : 0.476-1.987, 𝐴𝑀𝐸 = −0.1608;−0.181)$ for moderate and severe
stunting respectively.

__Conclusion:__

This study concludes that prevalence of higher-level malnutrition leads to stunting are
highly associated with lowest socio-economic status. And it reveals that the nutrition suffering at early
age leads to permanent irreversible impairment, and obviously affect future generations productivity.
Besides, it recommends both policy makers and stakeholders regarding the re-allocation of resources to
the most vulnerable population for health, educational and economic benefits.
